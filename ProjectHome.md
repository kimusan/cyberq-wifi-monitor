The <a href='http://www.thebbqguru.com/products/CyberQ-Wifi.html'>CyberQ Wifi</a> is a product of <a href='http://www.thebbqguru.com/'>BBQ Guru</a>, designed to monitor smoker/grill and meat temperature over wifi. It has 4 probes, 1 for pit temp and 3 for food. Additionally it also has an output for controlling fans for relays (internal PID logic). It includes a basic HTML interface out of the box. This project just adds an Android app to monitor the CyberQ Wifi service.

If you want to use this app outside of your home network you need to follow BBQ Guru's instructions, once that is configured you just enter the same hostname you would enter in your browser into the app. You can ports other than 80 if needed, just app it to the hostname, do not include the protocol, currently it only supports http.
